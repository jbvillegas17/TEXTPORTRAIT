Our praise goes up
Your rain comes down
Oh, with shouts of praise we celebrate
King of Glory enter in
You are riding on our praise
Oh, Lord
Turn it up this sound of praise (oh, yeah)
Make it louder than any other
Lift Him up and shout His name
Over all
Turn it up this sound of praise
Make it louder than any other
Lift Him up and shout His name
Over all
You are here as we lift You up
You are riding on our praise
Be enthroned over everything
You are seated in our praise
This is prophetic I can feel it in the air
We lift our praise and You change the atmosphere
With hearts open now everybody singing out
Oh-oh-oh
Turn it up this sound of praise
Make it louder than any other
Lift Him up and shout His name
Over all (yeah)
As we praise, I can feel the change
As Your presence now invades
Hear the sound of the broken chains
Prison doors are giving way
This is prophetic I can feel it in the air
We lift our praise and You change the atmosphere
With hearts open now everybody singing out
I am free
Turn it up this sound of praise
Make it louder than any other
Lift Him up and shout His name
Over all (turn it up)
Turn it up this sound of praise
Make it louder than any other
Lift Him up and shout His name
Over all (somebody lift your hands and shout His praise)
Our praise goes up
Your rain comes down
Our praise goes up
Your rain comes down
Oh, our praise goes up
Your rain comes down

Your rain comes down
Oh, with shouts of praise we celebrate
